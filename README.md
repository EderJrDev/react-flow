# 🚀 React Flow - Exploring the Library

This is a simple project created to understand and explore the functionality of **React Flow**. The goal is to learn the basic concepts and how to use this powerful library to build interactive **flowcharts** and **diagrams** in **React**.

---

## 📌 What is React Flow?

[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) is a library for **React** that makes it easy to create **flows, diagrams, and interactive graphs**. It provides a flexible structure to handle **nodes** and **edges**, allowing for **advanced customization** and interactivity.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- **Render Nodes and Connections** 🚀
- **Built-in Drag & Drop Support** 🖱️
- **Zoom and Pan Capabilities** 🔍
- **Event Handling & State Management** 🎛️
- **Highly Customizable Elements** 🎨

## 📚 Basic Concepts of React Flow
🏗️ Core Structure
React Flow works with three main elements:

Nodes: Represent the visual elements of the flow.
Edges: Connect the nodes and define the paths between them.
ReactFlow Component: The main container where nodes and edges are rendered.

## 🎨 Simple Example
        import ReactFlow, { Background, Controls, MiniMap } from 'reactflow';
        import 'reactflow/dist/style.css';
        
        const nodes = [
          { id: '1', position: { x: 100, y: 100 }, data: { label: 'Start' } },
          { id: '2', position: { x: 250, y: 250 }, data: { label: 'End' } }
        ];
        
        const edges = [
          { id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2' }
        ];
        
        const FlowDiagram = () => {
          return (
            <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges}>
              <Background />
              <Controls />
              <MiniMap />
            </ReactFlow>
          );
        };
        
        export default FlowDiagram;
## 🎯 Project Goal
